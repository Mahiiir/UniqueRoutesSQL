-- Method - 1 Using GREATEST AND LEAST Function:

SELECT GREATEST(source, destination) AS source, LEAST(source, destination) AS destination, max(distance) AS distnace
FROM travel
GROUP BY GREATEST(source, destination), LEAST(source, destination);

-- Method - 2 Using Self JOIN:

SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS SNo

)
SELECT t1.*
FROM cte As t1
JOIn cte AS t2
ON t1.source = t2.destination
AND t1.SNo < t2.SNo

-- Method - 3 Using SUBQUERY:

SELECT *
FROM travel t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM travel t2
			WHERE t1.source = t2.destination
			AND t2.source = t1.destination
			AND t1.destination > t2.destination
